Project:   <clotho>
Author: Patrick Putnam

DESCRIPTION
    
    <clotho> is a forward-time population genetics simulation C/C++ template library.
The goal of the project is to provide flexible objects which can be used to 
form the basis of a population genetic simulator.  The project should be able to
take full advantage of the hardware resources available at the time of execution.

    Clotho was one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology.  She spun the thread
of human life, and was responsible for deciding when a person was born, and 
therefore their lives.

OVERVIEW
    - Dependencies
    - Compilation
    - Useful Commands


DEPENDENCIES
    - CMake 2.8 (or higher)
    - Boost 1.54.0 (or higher)
    - TCMalloc (https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/)

COMPILATION
    Execute the following commands in the main project directory:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make

    - The example programs will be in the bin sub-directory.

    - The 'build' directory is ment to keep the compiled object files from being created in the main
    project directory (ie. to keep the project directories clean).

    - Executing 'make doc' will create the Doxygen files for the project in the 'docs' sub-directory.
        * The Doxygen files are work in progress


USEFUL COMMANDS:

Compilation Variable: BUILD_CUDA_EXAMPLES
Description: Turns on/off whether the CUDA examples are compiled or not
Example Command: mkdir -p build/cuda; cd build/cuda; cmake -DBUILD_CUDA_EXAMPLES=ON ../..; make; cd ../..
