The QTL Estimator is a Forward Time Population Genetic Simulator designed to
explore the phenotypic effects of individual mutations.  It is designed to be
equally an example of how one could utilize the objects provided in the Clotho
template library, as well as a simulator.

Simulation Scenario:

The scenario being simulated considers a fixed-size population of N
diploid individuals under random mating (panmixia). 

This simulator is designed to consider each mutation as affecting the phenotype of
individuals possessing it.  We term the phenotypic effect as a trait weight.  That is,
each mutation has a weight value for each of the traits being studied.  The trait weights
are generated from a configurable Normal distribution.  In effect, each allele is a row 
in a weight matrix, W.  Each column of W represents a trait.  For simplicity, this simulator
was designed to consider scenarios with fixed maximum number of traits, T.

The phenotype of an individual is measured by summing the trait weights of both sequences
which define an individual.  In this simulation, environmental factors are not considered.
Therefore, P = G + E = G + 0 = G, where G is the weighted genotype of the individual.

P = [1] * I * W = [ 1, 1 ]_[1 x 2] * [s_0; s_1]_[2 x M ] * [ m_0; m_1; m_3; ...; m_M ]_[M x T]

Each mutation may also affect the selection of an individual.  The selection of an allele
is controlled by selection and dominance coefficients from a uniform [0,1) distribution.
Whether a mutation affects selection is controlled by a Bernoulli process with a
configurable value of p.  By setting p=1, all new mutations are neutral (no selection); a
p=0 value means all mutations affect selection.

Mating pairs are chosen randomly from a Discrete distribution using the fitness vector
of the population as the weight vector.  When all mutations are neutral, the fitness
of each individual is equal to 1.  Technically, this is equivalent to Uniform distribution.
It is worth noting that "selfing" is allowed to occur under this mating model.

The reproduction procedure considers an Infinite Site Mutation model.  Mutation events
are generated following a Poisson distribution with a configurable mean, mu.  The site
of a mutation is randomly generated from a uniformly between [0,1).  There can be at most
1 mutation for a site with in the current generation of population.  That is, if a randomly
generated site is either fixed or variable for the current generation, then the site is
re-generated.  

Lost mutations are not considered to be a "reoccurrence" of the mutation.
Rather, lost mutations are re-generated each time they occur.  The phenotypic effects, and
if applicable the selection and dominance coefficients, are also re-generated.

The recombination events are also generated following a Poisson distribution with a
configurable mean, rho.  The event positions are randomly selected uniformly from [0, 1).
